#About branches
Branches will avoid programatic working code deployment into server
In many ways it will helpful when you working with different people Instead of messing around in the same branch we will introduce new branches so that proper will deploy
into server and make changes agaian push back to same branch.
Consider I have production main branch I will add only working codes into this branch for testing the code I create the new branch it will helpful in testing the code
before send into production.
